# My Notes App

This is a simple notes app built with React. It allows users to create, update, and delete notes, as well as search for specific notes. The app uses React-Icons and UUID libraries. 

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


Clone and setup the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    - git clone https://github.com/utk145/My-Notes-App-using-React
    - npm install --legacy-peer-deps
